⚙️ How It Works

Training Phase

Student images are converted into face encodings

Each encoding is stored along with the corresponding roll number

Real-Time Scanning

Camera captures the entire classroom

Multiple faces are detected in a single frame

Each face is matched with stored encodings

Attendance Calculation

Attendance is tracked for 7 subjects

Subject-wise percentages are calculated

Overall attendance is computed as the average of subject percentages

Output Generation

A single Excel file is generated

One row per student for the entire day
